Introduction to zmobile

This page briefly introduces J2ME to those of you who have never used it and/or know little about mobile programming. It also compares it to the other available technologies.

What is J2ME?

J2ME stands for "Java 2 Mobile Edition". It is Java's specification for devices with low memory and other constraints. In practice this means it is used for programming cell phones.

If you know Java (i.e. the Standard Edition) you know about 90% of J2ME. Some of the differences are:

Language Features - J2ME uses Java 1.3's syntax so it does not support boxing, attributes, or other new language features.
Library - It uses a subset of the Java Foundation Classes. However, there are some new classes which are all found in the javax.microedition.* packages.
Packaging - Applications are assembled into a single Jar file (libraries like zmobile must be included in the Jar). Jar files are accompanied by a small .jad file which contains installation properties for the .jar.
To learn more about J2ME follow our setup guide and build your hello world application. Then look over the examples included with the zmobile distribution to see more complex examples.
